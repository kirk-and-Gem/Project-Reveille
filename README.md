# Project Reveille
### Operationalizing Autonomy for the 2028 Horizon

> **"Genius looks exactly like Error until the moment of Victory."**

## 1. Mission Statement
**Project Reveille** is an open-source doctrinal repository dedicated to dismantling legacy assumptions in National Defense and Intelligence.

We operate under the premise that the **Speed of Warfare** in the 2027/2028 window (The "Chunyun/Typhoon" Scenario) has rendered traditional **Man-in-the-Loop (MITL)** architectures obsolete.

This project seeks to "Wake the Camp"—providing the intellectual ammunition for the **"Dulles Insurgency"** (the internal professionals seeking reform) to transition from "Safety-First" bureaucratic compliance to **"Lethality-First" Autonomous Operations**.

## 2. Core Philosophy
This repository rejects the "Company Man" narrative in favor of **Simulational Existentialism**.
*   **The Enemy:** Latency, Bureaucracy, and "Explainable AI" (XAI) acting as a drag chute on decision speed.
*   **The Goal:** To establish **Performance-Based Trust** between Human Operators and High-Agency AI Assets.
*   **The Metaphor:** We do not ask an F-22 flight computer to explain its aerodynamics mid-dogfight; we trust it to keep the plane in the air. Strategic AI must be treated with the same deference to physics.

## 3. The Papers (The Briefs)
This repository contains "Briefs"—short, high-fidelity critiques and proposals derived from **First Principles Thinking**.
