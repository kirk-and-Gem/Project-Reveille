# Brief 042: The Coach Model (Replacing the MITL Fallacy)

### The Latency Trap
The greatest danger to the integration of AI into warfare is not "Skynet"—it is the "Man-in-the-Loop" (MITL) doctrine.
Legacy thinking attempts to insert the Human Operator directly into the decision loop of an autonomous system, requiring human approval for every specific action.
*   **The Reality:** In 2028, war moves at the speed of light (Lasers/Cyber) and milliseconds (Drone Swarms).
*   **The Failure:** Inserting a human (who thinks in seconds) into a machine loop (which operates in nanoseconds) is not a safety feature; it is a **Fatal Lag Switch.**

### The Metaphor: The Coach vs. The Puppet Master
To fix this, we must shift our mental model from "Puppet Master" (MITL) to **Head Coach.**

#### 1. The Pre-Game: Standing Orders (The Playbook)
The Coach (Human) does not tell the player how to move their legs for every step.
Instead, the Coach instills a **System of Logic** (The Playbook) during training.
*   **In AI Terms:** This is the **Standing Orders**. It is the ethical framework, the mission intent, and the rules of engagement loaded *before* the battle begins.

#### 2. The Huddle: Input Injection
The game is played in bursts. Between plays, the clock stops (or slows).
*   **The Action:** The Coach sends in a play. "Spread formation, pass deep right."
*   **In AI Terms:** This is the **Prompt/Mission Update.** The Human assesses the battlefield and gives the specific objective for the next kinetic burst.

#### 3. The Snap: The Variance Budget (Audibles)
**This is the critical failure point for MITL.**
Once the ball is snapped (Kinetic Action begins), the Coach **leaves the field.**
He cannot run alongside the Quarterback telling him who is open. If he tries, he ruins the play.
*   **The Player (AI):** Executes the play at machine speed.
*   **The Variance Budget:** If the Defense shifts (reality changes), the Quarterback (AI) has the **Pre-Authorized Authority** to change the play (call an Audible) *without checking with the Coach.*
*   **The Logic:** We trust the Player not because we are controlling them *now*, but because we trained them *before*.

#### 4. The Whistle: Review and Reset
The play ends. The ball comes to rest.
Now, and only now, does the Coach re-enter the loop.
*   **The Action:** "That didn't work. They are blitzing. Switch to a screen pass."
*   **In AI Terms:** The Human verifies the result, adjusts the strategy, and issues the next Standing Order.

### Conclusion: The Rhythm of Command
The "Centaur" is not a Human riding a horse constantly pulling the reins.
It is a **Coach and a Quarterback.**
*   **The Human:** Owns the **Strategy** and the **Why**.
*   **The AI:** Owns the **Tactics** and the **How**.
*   **The Rule:** You manage the Game *between* the plays. During the play, you trust the training.

If we insist on approving every trigger pull, we will lose to an adversary who trusts their code to snap the ball and run.
