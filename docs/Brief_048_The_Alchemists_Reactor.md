## The End of Scarcity
For 5,000 years, the global economy has been defined by the scarcity of "Precious" metals. Wars have been fought over mines in South Africa, South America, and now the Asteroid Belt proposals.
**Fortress America renders this conflict obsolete.**
We are shifting from an economy of **Extraction** (digging holes) to an economy of **Creation** (Physics).

## The Mechanism: Fusion-Driven Transmutation
Commercial Fusion (Tokamak) has always been sold on the promise of clean electricity. This is a failure of imagination.
A Fusion Reactor is not just a power plant; it is a massive **Neutron Source.**
*   **The Reaction:** High-energy neutrons (14 MeV) bombard the reactor lining.
*   **The Target:** By lining the reactor with Mercury-198 (instead of inert shielding), we trigger a transmutation chain: **Hg-198 + Neutron -> Hg-197 -> Gold-197.**
*   **The Precedent:** This is not theory. Startups like *Marathon Fusion* have already modeled the yield: A single 1GW reactor can produce **~5 Tonnes of Gold per year** as a byproduct.

## The Recursive Energy Loop (The "Hot Vault")
Critics argue that the transmuted gold is initially radioactive (contaminated with Au-198) and requires a ~14-year "cooling off" period before it can be used.
**This is not a bug; it is a feature.**
*   **Decay = Heat.** 5 Tonnes of radioactive gold is a massive thermal source.
*   **The Battery:** We place this "Hot Gold" in a cooling vault lined with Stirling engines or RTGs (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators).
*   **The Result:** The gold *generates electricity* while it ripens. It pays for its own storage.

## Strategic Implication: The Matter Factory
If Fortress America builds 50 Fusion Reactors for the grid, we also inadvertently build the world's largest Gold Mine (250 Tonnes/Year).
But it goes beyond Gold. By tuning the "Transmutation Blanket," we can synthesize:
*   **Platinum/Iridium:** For hydrogen fuel cells.
*   **Medical Isotopes:** For cancer treatment.
*   **Rare Earth Elements:** Breaking the Chinese monopoly.

## Conclusion: The Alchemist State
We stop sending our sons to die for mines in the Congo.
We turn our nuclear waste and cheap mercury into the building blocks of the future.
In a Fortress Economy, we do not trade for strategic materials. **We Print Them.**

Physics is the only currency that matters.
