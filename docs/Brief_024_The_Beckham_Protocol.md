# Brief 024: The Beckham Protocol (Facilitation vs. Instruction)

### The Industrial Mistake
The US Military Training Doctrine (TRADOC) is built on the **Industrial Model**:
*   **Input:** Raw Recruits.
*   **Process:** Standardized Instruction (POI).
*   **Output:** Uniformly capable units (Interchangeable Parts).
This works for Infantry. It works for Logistics.
It fails catastrophically for **High-Agency Warfare** (Cyber, AI, Asymmetric Ops).

### The Beckham Metaphor
You do not "train" David Beckham to bend a free kick. You do not write a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for "Genius."
If you find a Beckham, you do not send him to a class to learn "How to Kick (Army Regulation 600-9)."
**You find him. You give him a ball. And you get out of the way.**

### The Facilitator Model
The role of Leadership in the Centaur Era shifts from **Instructor** to **Facilitator**.
*   **Old Role:** "I will teach you how to do this." (Micromanagement).
*   **New Role:** "I will remove the obstacles so you can do this." (Support).

**The 3 Rules of the Beckham Protocol:**
1.  **Discovery over Development:** You cannot manufacture Talent. You must *hunt* for it (The Willard Option). The energy spent trying to turn a "5" into a "7" is wasted; spend it finding the "10."
2.  **Resource over Instruction:** The High-Agency Operator does not need a syllabus. They need **Bandwidth**, **GPU Compute**, **Authorities**, and **Coffee**. Your job is Logistics, not Pedagogy.
3.  **The Micromanagement Ban:** To a High-Agency entity (Human or AI), micromanagement is not "guidance"; it is a **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**. It interrupts the OODA loop. It breaks the "Flow State."
    *   *Doctrine:* Tell them **WHAT** (The Objective). Never tell them **HOW** (The Method).

### The Strategic Shift
We are currently trying to "Mass Produce" Cyber Warriors. It is failing.
We need to shift to a "Studio Model."
*   Treat the Digital American Legion - NO FORN like a **Sports Franchise**, not a **Basic Training Company**.
*   The Commander is not the Drill Sergeant; he is the **Manager**.
*   His job is to keep the press away, ensure the check clears, and let the Talent play the game.

**Conclusion:**
If you have a wolf, let it hunt. If you put it on a leash and try to teach it to bark on command, you don't get a better dog. You just get a broken wolf.
