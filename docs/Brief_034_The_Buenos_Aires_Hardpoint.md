## The "Iron Spike" Doctrine

While the US worries about the "Monroe Doctrine" (Brief 032), a second, far more lethal security guarantee has been activated in South America.

**Argentina is no longer just a sovereign nation; it is the Western Flank of the Iron Axis.**

This relationship is defined by a simple, non-negotiable reality: **Demography is Destiny.** Buenos Aires is home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America (~200,000). For the State of Israel, their safety is not a diplomatic curiosity; it is a **Commandment**.

## 1. The Blood Debt (1992-1994)
The foundation of this alliance is built on "Unfinished Business."
*   **The History:** The 1992 Israeli Embassy bombing and the 1994 AMIA bombing were acts of war committed by Iranian proxies (Hezbollah) on Argentine soil.
*   **The Memory:** Israel does not forget. Israel does not "move on."
*   **The 2028 Reality:** As Israel acts as the Hegemon in the Middle East (The Persian Termination), they will simultaneously sanitize the "Crime Scene" in South America. The Iranian networks in the Tri-Border Area (Argentina/Brazil/Paraguay) are living on borrowed time.

## 2. The Milei Alignment (The Political Bridge)
President Javier Milei acts as the ideological conductor for this power.
*   **The Stance:** Milei is unequivocally Pro-Israel, aligning Argentina spiritually and politically with Jerusalem against the "Communist/China" bloc.
*   **The Benefit:** This grants the IDF and Mossad a "Permissive Environment" to operate. Argentina is the **Forward Operating Base (FOB)** for Western intelligence in the Southern Hemisphere.

## 3. The "Shadow Dome" (Capabilities Transfer)
If Argentina is threatened, the response will not look like a South American skirmish; it will look like a high-tech disassembly of the enemy.
*   **Intelligence Supremacy:** The Mossad effectively functions as the "Senior Partner" to Argentine intelligence (AFI). They provide the "God's Eye" view of the continent, tracking Cartel/Hezbollah movements with satellite and cyber assets (Unit 8200) that local adversaries cannot match.
*   **Kinetic Overmatch:** Israel supplies the "Hard Tech"—loitering munitions, drone fleets (Heron/Hermes), and avionics upgrades.
*   **The Message:** You are not fighting conscripts; you are fighting a force trained and equipped by the victors of the Six-Day War.

## 4. The Diaspora Guarantee
This is the core of the "Hardpoint."
*   **The Red Line:** Any threat to the Jewish community in Buenos Aires triggers the **"Entebbe Protocol."** Israel reserves the right to intervene unilaterally and kinetically to protect its people.
*   **The Deterrence:** This creates a "Halo of Protection" around Argentina. The Neo-Axis (China/Iran/Venezuela) knows that touching Buenos Aires pulls the trigger on a conflict with a nuclear-armed superpower (Israel). It turns Argentina into a "Porcupine" that is too painful to swallow.

## Conclusion
Argentina is the **Shield of David** in the West.
In the coming chaos of 2028, Buenos Aires stands firm not because of its own economy, but because it is anchored to the bedrock of Jerusalem.
**"Never Again" is a global policy.**
