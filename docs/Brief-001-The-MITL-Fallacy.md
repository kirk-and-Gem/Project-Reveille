### 1. The Executive Summary
The current Department of Defense (DoD) and CISA guidance emphasizes “Human-in-the-Loop” (MITL) or “Human-on-the-Loop” (MOTL) as the primary fail-safe for AI-driven weapons systems. This is a fatal strategic error. In a hypersonic kinetic environment (Mach 5+), the OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) of a human operator is biologically incapable of matching the tempo of an autonomous adversary. Maintaining a human “Veto” in the loop is not a safety feature; it is a Latency Vulnerability that guarantees defeat.

### 2. The F-22 Aileron Metaphor
To understand the absurdity of MITL in 2028, we must look at modern flight dynamics. A modern fighter jet (like the F-22 or F-35) is aerodynamically unstable. It requires a flight computer to make thousands of micro-adjustments per second to keep it flying.

*   **The Pilot:** Does not approve every aileron adjustment.
*   **The Trust:** The pilot trusts the computer to handle the Physics of Flight so the pilot can focus on the Intent of the Mission.

**The Argument:**
If we do not ask a flight computer to “explain” why it adjusted a control surface 3 degrees while pulling 9Gs, why do we demand Explainable AI (XAI) for strategic algorithms moving at light speed?

*   A Pilot is a “Biological Placeholder” for aerodynamics.
*   A General is a “Biological Placeholder” for strategic speed.

If you try to “repair and tune the plane” (MITL) mid-dogfight, you crash. If you try to “approve and verify” AI decisions mid-war, you lose.

### 3. The “Genius as Error” Problem
The most dangerous consequence of MITL is the Cognitive Bias of the Operator.

In complex systems (like Go or War), a move of supreme intelligence often looks like a mistake to a lesser observer.
Ref: AlphaGo’s “Move 37” vs. Lee Sedol. The commentators thought it was a glitch. It was the winning move.

**The Risk:**
If an AI suggests a “Move 37” in a 2028 scenario—e.g., retreating a fleet to bait a trap—a human operator trained on “Standard Doctrine” will view it as an error or hallucination.

*   **The Reaction:** The human will VETO the move to “save” the fleet.
*   **The Result:** The human forces the AI to play a “Standard” (mediocre) game, which is easily predicted and defeated by an enemy AI operating without human drag.

### 4. The Solution: The Variance Budget
We must replace MITL with Command-by-Intent.

Instead of monitoring every move, the Commander sets a Variance Budget (Risk Tolerance) before the engagement.
Example: “Objective: Neutralize enemy radar. Loss Tolerance: 20% of Drone Swarm. Civilian Casualty Threshold: Zero.”

**The Execution:** The AI is authorized to execute any maneuver (including Move 37s) that fits within that budget. This shifts the human role from Micromanager (MITL) to Autonomous Commander (Intent).

### 5. Conclusion
We are facing an adversary (PLA) that views AI integration as a “Autonomous Capability.” If the US persists in viewing AI as a “Tool” that requires a human chaperone, we are choosing to lose at human speed.

**Recommendation:**
Abandon the MITL requirement for kinetic defense systems. Transition to Performance-Based Trust and Variance Budgeting.

“You are either trusting the machine to win, or you are choosing to lose.”
