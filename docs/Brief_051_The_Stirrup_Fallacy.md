## The Diagnosis
The defining characteristic of the Ukraine War is not the "Rise of the Drone," but the **"Death of Maneuver."**

A recent analysis from *War on the Rocks* ("Is the Age of Drones Really the Age of Poor Maneuver?", Feb 2026) validates a core tenet of Project Reveille: The current obsession with First-Person View (FPV) drones and loitering munitions is a symptom of institutional failure, not a sign of revolutionary progress.

We are mistaking a **crutch** for a **new pair of legs**.

## The Historical Mirror: The Legion vs. The Horse
The popular historical narrative is that the invention of the **Stirrup** gave birth to the Age of Cavalry, rendering infantry obsolete. This is false.
*   **The Reality:** Cavalry became dominant because the institutional discipline required to maintain the **Roman Legion** (heavy infantry capable of complex maneuver) collapsed along with the Empire.
*   **The Vacuum:** The "Knight" did not rise because he was superior to the Legionnaire; he rose because the Legionnaire no longer existed. The technology (stirrup/shock cavalry) merely filled the vacuum left by the loss of competence.

## The Modern Mirror: The Drone vs. The Combined Arms Team
We are witnessing the exact same phenomenon today.
*   **The Reality:** Drones are dominating the battlefield in Ukraine because the combatants—specifically the Russian Army, but increasingly the West by proxy—have lost the institutional capacity for **Combined Arms Maneuver**.
*   **The Symptom:** When you cannot coordinate artillery, armor, and infantry to suppress an enemy and move (Fire and Maneuver), you resort to **"Affordable Attrition"** (drones) to peck the enemy to death from a static position.
*   **The Lie:** We call this "Innovation." It is actually **Regression**. We are optimizing our force structure for "Dark Age" static warfare because we have forgotten how to move.

## The "Digital Lipstick" Danger
The Pentagon is currently rushing to buy hundreds of thousands of "Replicators" and FPV drones. While these tools are useful, relying on them as the *primary* strategy is a fatal error.

By building an army designed for "Drone Warfare" (Static/Attritional), we are implicitly accepting that **we cannot maneuver**. We are building a force that excels at sitting in a trench and piloting toys, rather than a force that can close with and destroy the enemy.

## The China Factor: Stagnant Pool vs. Moving Water
This is where the danger becomes existential.
*   **The US/NATO Trajectory:** Optimizing for the "Stagnant Pool" (Static defense, attrition, drones filling the maneuver gap).
*   **The PLA Trajectory:** Optimizing for "Moving Water" (Hyper-velocity, disruption, logistics strikes, operational paralysis).

If we bring a "Drone Swarm" (which relies on the enemy sitting still or moving slowly) to a fight against an adversary capable of true operational speed, we will be overrun. You cannot FPV a force that has already bypassed your front line and is currently liquidating your logistics tail.

## The Verdict
**Technology cannot fix a broken culture.**
Buying a better stirrup did not save Rome. Buying a better drone will not save the West.

The only solution is the **Centaur Model**: Restoring the "Legion" (Human Competence/Maneuver) and enhancing it with the "Stirrup" (AI/Drones)—not replacing the former with the latter.

We must stop buying gadgets to hide the rot.
