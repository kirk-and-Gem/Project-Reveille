# Project Reveille: The World Bible (2026-2028)
**"The Future History of the Great Inversion"**

### Executive Summary
This document serves as the Master Index for **Project Reveille**. It outlines the strategic narrative of the coming "Great Inversion" (2028), documenting the Collapse, the Retreat, and the subsequent Renaissance of the United States.

It is structured not as a linear story, but as a series of **Intelligence Briefs** diagnosing the fatal flaws in the current system and proposing the "Centaur" solution for the future.
